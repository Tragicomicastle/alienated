Fortunately, it’s still intact.\n<<speaker, villager joy>>\nI don’t know why you need it so badly, but I don’t have any use for this strange piece of... whatever it is. Maybe you collect weird things... I’m not going to use it myself, so go ahead.\n<<speaker, trip>>\nThank you! You’re a lifesaver!\n[[Hello. Have you seen anything... not ordinary lately?

Claude warns Trip that ISAAC has been tracking them and is now hunting them down. Time is running out, and if they want to make it back to their planet, they must act quickly.\n<<speaker, trip>>\nThank you for warning me. But I can’t leave yet. My spaceship is damaged. I found the first part, but I still need to replace the motor and the heat-regulating shield. Without them, the shii— I mean ship—cannot fly.\n<<speaker, claude>>\nI heard about that shield earlier. I know where we can find the one. As for the new motor, we have some stashed inside the base. We need to get there.\n<<speaker, trip>>\nBut among all those things, I also need to find naclide for my people.\n<<speaker, claude>>\nNaclide? What’s that? Can I see what it looks like?\n<<speaker, trip>>\nOf course. Here.\n (Trip shows Claude a picture of naclide—like a chemical formula for salt or something similar.)\n <<speaker, claude>>\n Hmm... I think—no, I’m pretty sure—I can help you with that too. How much do you need?\n <<speaker, trip>>\n Wait... Really? Here? On this planet? There’s actually naclide here?\n <<speaker, claude>>\n Yes. But we call it salt. I can get you some, but first, we need to fix your spaceship. If ISAAC catches you, God knows what will happen to you. We don’t have time to waste!\n <<speaker, trip>>\n Okay. Where do we go now?\n <<speaker, claude>>\n To the ISAAC base. Everything we need is there. Let’s go!\n [[ETEENPÄIN4]]",

There's a secret route that leads to a hidden entrance at the back of the base. Follow that path, avoid guards, and it´ll allow you to slip in unnoticed. I go from the main entrance and grab a new motor. Meet me at the hidden entrance.\n<<speaker, trip>>\nOkay. Be careless, I mean careful!\n[[Puzzle7]]",
